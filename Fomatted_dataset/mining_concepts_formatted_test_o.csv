Determine the dry density of the soil? [/INST] The solution is: To find the dry density of the soil, we need to use the relationship between bulk density , dry density , and water content (w). Given information: - bulk density of the soil = 27 kN/m³, water content = 50 %. The bulk density is the total weight of the soil (solids and water) per unit volume, and the dry density is the weight of solids per unit volume.
